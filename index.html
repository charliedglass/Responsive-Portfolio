                <p>Hello!  My name is Charlie Glass.  I was born and raised in New York City, and I moved out to Los Angeles 4 years ago when I started studying at UCLA.  I graduated from UCLA in the summer of 2018 with a B.S. in Mathematics/Economics and a Specialization in Computing.  Following graduation, I started my current job as an Associate Business Intelligence Analyst at Blackwood Seven, a company that uses advanced analytics and modeling to advise and execute clients’ media plans.  Previously, I worked in Data Analytics for Music Audience Exchange and the Los Angeles Kings.  I am currently enrolled in UCLA Extension’s Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp, where I hope to gain the skills necessary to build web tools for my data projects.</p>
                <p>I am deeply passionate about sports.  I try to play basketball everyday, as well as coach middle schoolers in basketball when I am free.  Growing up, I became a die-hard Knicks and Yankees fan, so I have experienced both sides of the fan spectrum!  I hope to one day combine my passion for sports and data and obtain a job in sports analytics either in baseball or basketball!</p>
